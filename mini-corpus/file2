Tell me, is therenothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?”“Not that I know of.”“Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your ownhand-writing—carelessly disguised?”“No, I do not think so.”“I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!”“No.”“I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived theidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote thisnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!”“No.”“Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waitingabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in thechemist’s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine inthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?”“No, that is a lie.”“I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp’s clothes, witha black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there—and signed theregister in his name!”“That is absolutely untrue.”“Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing betweenthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of thejury,” said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who hasdone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberateperjury.
